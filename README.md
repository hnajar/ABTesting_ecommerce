# ABTesting_ecommerce
The project shows a practice on p_value calculation, AB testing and linear regression
This project aims at discovering if people are interested in converting to a new webpage after changing a feature or not. 
I define the hypotheses and tried to compare different approaches to see how they differ in conclusion. 
Specifially, I manually calculated the p-value based on my null and alternate hypothesis, used built-in function to get the p-value and logistic regression.
I came to the same conclusion using all the abovementioned approaches.
